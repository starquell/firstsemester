Task :

      Sort strings (firtsly by length, then lexicographically) by next sort algorithms:
      
                                                     - Selection sort
                                                     - Quick sort (Hoare partition scheme, middle index pivot)
                                                     - Merge sort (top-down, two arrays)
                                                     - Combined sort (Choosing best algorithm for subarray)
                                                     - Sort from STL
     
There're two behavior types implemented :  - presentation mode
                                           - benchmark
         
Default mode is presentation, to run benchmark, launch with parameter --benchmark.

Benchmark results on my notebook is in "benchmarkResults.txt".
